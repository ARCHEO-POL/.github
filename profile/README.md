## *Une archéologie des discours politiques réformés (XVIe siècle). Des sources à la loupe. La Bibliothèque des Monarchomaques.*

FNS Project 2024-2028, under the direction of Paul-Alexis Mellet

## Project

In her 2013 book *Le Pouvoir Absolu*, the historian Arlette Jouanna reflected with perplexity on the strangeness of the Renaissance: “how can we recover a world that today feels so distant?” Yet she immediately answered with enthusiasm: the task is worth pursuing, for “it is from the reflections of thinkers of the past that concepts were born which still endure at the heart of political thought: sovereignty, the State, the right of resistance, the liberty of individuals.” These are precisely the very concepts, inherited from Antiquity and the Middle Ages, that were unearthed, updated, and rearticulated in the European context of the sixteenth-century Wars of Religion, giving rise to the so-called “monarchomach” theory. The idea of legitimate armed resistance in the name of public liberties then had a long afterlife, for example in Hobbes and Rousseau, in the English, American, and French Revolutions, and even in the protest movements in Europe and the United States in 1968. But where does this idea come from exactly? How was it constituted?

The aim of this research project is to focus on the sources of these concepts and to renew our understanding of the Monarchomachs, those Calvinist jurists and theologians of the late sixteenth century who justified armed resistance. Although well known today, many areas remain obscure: the precise list of works and their re-editions, the critical responses, the influences, and above all the sources and references. The project therefore seeks to offer transversal analyses of texts often studied in isolation, while adopting an original approach: the study of the sources from which they drew inspiration. What were their intellectual training and their readings? How did they interpret the Bible, the philosophers of Antiquity, the medieval jurists, or the historians who preceded them? What influences did these intellectual and editorial practices generate? For them, historical precedent did not merely make possible a form inherited from the past; it made it real by showing that it had already existed (Grafton and Schwab 2022).

Yet these ancient examples also had to be elevated into exemplary models for the present or the future (Hampton 1990; Giavarini 2008). The system thus rested on a true “theory of sources”: their nature (which ones?) and their function (what models for the future?). These sources—sometimes shared by Catholics and Protestants alike (Frank 2023)—were at the heart of major controversies during the Wars of Religion. Ultimately, it was these very sources that shaped the contours of a polemical method, the “critical demand in pamphlet writing” (Christin 2014), which has endured up to the present day.

The project thus proposes to reread the Monarchomach treatises from the perspective of the sources on which they relied. To carry out this study of a corpus redefined and enriched for research purposes, we propose to make use of digital tools that will make it possible to identify these sources, to compare them across texts, to measure their impact and reception in other writings and contexts—especially in the critiques they elicited. From an epistemological standpoint, computational analysis indeed provides powerful tools for exploring expanded corpora.
